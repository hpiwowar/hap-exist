Data is from "Hormonal characteristics of the human menstrual cycle throughout reproductive life." J Clin Invest. 1975;55(4):699-706. doi:10.1172/JCI107979.
Figure 3: "The mean and range of serum LH, FSH, E., and P in five women, age 40-41, are compared to the mean +2 SEM in 10 cycles in women aged 18-30."
Testosterone from a variety of sources, estimated.
