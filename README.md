Playing with @ExistApp,❤️.
But I want to correlate w my hormone cycle.  
So I estimated my testosterone,estrogen,progesterone then used API to insert as if my Instagram post,likes,comments stats.

see what it looks like when it is inserted:

Hormone level estimates are from [10.1172/JCI107979](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC301805/?page=3): "Serum gonadotropin and steroid patterns during the normal menstrual cycle." J Clin Invest. 1975 Apr; 55(4): 699–706.
Specifically, Figure 3: "The mean and range of serum LH, FSH, E., and P in five women, age 40-41, are compared to the mean +2 SEM in 10 cycles in women aged 18-30."

Except testosterone, which i roughly estimated from a number of online graphs.
